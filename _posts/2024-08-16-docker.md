## Permission denied

When runing a docker command in the terminal, the terminal output

```text
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.46/containers/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

Check if docker group exists

```bash
cat /etc/group|grep docker
```

Check if current user belongs to docker group

```bash
groups $USER
```

If not

1. Add current user to the docker group
  
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

1. Log in to the new docker group (to avoid having to log out / log in again; but if not enough, try to reboot)

   ```bash
   newgrp docker
   ```

## Change root directory

Use `docker info` to check the current root directory. Follow [Daemon data directory](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/#daemon-data-directory) to change the root directory. Restart the daemon

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## GPU

Follow [Access an NVIDIA GPU](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/resource_constraints/#access-an-nvidia-gpu) to add GPU support. Restart the daemon

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
