## Driver Version VS. CUDA Version

As stated in [CUDA Compatibility](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/):

> Every CUDA toolkit also ships with an NVIDIA display driver package for convenience. This driver supports all the features introduced in that version of the CUDA Toolkit. Please check the toolkit and driver version mapping in the release notes. The driver package includes both the user mode CUDA driver (libcuda.so) and kernel mode components necessary to run the application.

The driver shiped with CUDA can be found in [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Release Notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/).
